DOCUMENTATION AND GUIDE TO RUN SCRIPT

ORS IMAGE PROJECT:

Three Tasks:
1. Re-Naming
2. Path tracing

1. Re-naming is done through excel file or .ods file.
2. Path tracing :

   Algorithm used to extract foreground is GrabCut.

   *Key part of this algorithm is to find a bounding box around the region of interest.
   *To find bounding box, I used extreme contour points.
   *But the bounding box obtained won't give accurate results.
   *For each kind of image adding or subtracting values in range [-5,+5] can improve the foreground extraction.
   *This has to be done manually by user to get the desired output.
   *These values are e1,e2,e3,e4 which user inputs.

   Rules to enter e - values :

   -> sign followed by integer between 0 to 5 (inclusive)
   -> if zero enter +0
   Examples : +0,+2,-5,-2 etc.


Steps to run the program (On Ubuntu System):

Explained detailed in Guide.pdf

1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded GrabCut_F.
3. You need to give four inputs
   1. Path of the input folder from working directory.
   2. Path of the output folder from working directory.
   3. Path of the excel file which contains product name and it's number
   4. Bounding error values e1,e2,e3,e4 in the range of [-5,+5]
4. Check if you got desired output.
5. If yes :- exit
6. Else run again with different e1,e2,e3,e4 values.
